```js
function addUp(num) {
  return (num * (num + 1)) / 2;
}
```

## Strategy

\_sir took a mathmatical approch for the solution.  
Because the difference between consecutive term is constant so he used the
arithmetical series to sum a sequance of numbers.

## Implementation

\_sir wrote a one-line implementation of his strategy that defines the the first
term plus the last term, multiply by the number of terms then divide by 2.

**parenthesis**: \_sir used the paranthesis first to add up the first term and
last term.

**arithmetic operator**: using the operactors `*` `+` and `/` to calculate the
solution.

## Possible Refactors

This strategy could also be implemented using these (but not only these)
Implementation ...

- an arrow function with implicit return

I am not a Math geek, so I had to check how the arimetic series work.
